## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**Just want to get started?** Here's the express version:

1. **Create missing packages:**
   ```bash
   cd TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode
   mkdir drive localization test
   ```

2. **Move TeleOp files:**
   ```bash
   mv DriveTeleOp*.java teleop/
   mv DualControllerAlign.java teleop/
   ```

3. **Move Drive files:**
   ```bash
   mv MecanumDrive.java drive/
   mv TankDrive.java drive/
   mv Drawing.java drive/
   ```

4. **Move Localization files:**
   ```bash
   mv *Localizer.java localization/
   mv GoBildaPinpointDriver.java localization/
   ```

5. **Update package declarations** in moved files:
   ```java
   package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.teleop;  // for TeleOp files
   package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.drive;   // for Drive files
   package org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.localization;  // for Localizer files
   ```

6. **Build and test:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

**Note:** This is the minimal quick start. For a complete, safe migration, follow the full [MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md](./MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md).

## üìã Summary of Recommendations

### Current State
- ‚úÖ **Good:** 10 organized packages with 41 files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs work:** 18 files in root package
- ‚úÖ **Good:** Archive folder with old code

### Target State
- ‚úÖ All files in logical packages
- ‚úÖ Root package clean (only readme.md)
- ‚úÖ 13 well-organized packages
- ‚úÖ Easy to find and understand code

### Key Packages to Add
1. `drive/` - Drive system implementations
2. `localization/` - Position tracking
3. `test/` - Testing and diagnostics

### Files to Reorganize
**High priority (must move):**
- 5 TeleOp files ‚Üí `teleop/`
- 3 Drive files ‚Üí `drive/`
- 6 Localization files ‚Üí `localization/`
- 2 Vision files ‚Üí `vision/`
- 2 Config files ‚Üí `config/` & `util/`
- 6 Test OpModes from `auton/` ‚Üí `test/`

---

## üéì Key Principles

### 1. **Organize by Purpose, Not Type**
Group files by what they do (e.g., `teleop/`) not by what they are (e.g., `opmodes/`)

### 2. **One Public Class Per File**
Each `.java` file should have exactly one public class matching the filename

### 3. **Clear, Descriptive Names**
Use names that explain what the code does: `BlueAllianceAutonRR` not `Auto1`

### 4. **Consistent Package Structure**
All team members should follow the same organization pattern

### 5. **Archive, Don't Delete**
Keep old code in `Archive/` for reference

---

## üìä Impact of Good Organization

### Before Organization
- ‚ùå Hard to find files
- ‚ùå Confusion about where new code goes
- ‚ùå Merge conflicts from everyone editing same package
- ‚ùå Slow onboarding for new members

### After Organization
- ‚úÖ Files easy to find by purpose
- ‚úÖ Clear conventions for new code
- ‚úÖ Reduced merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ Faster onboarding (10 min vs 1 hour)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and IDE Support

### Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA
- **Refactor ‚Üí Move:** Automatically updates imports
- **Find Usages:** See where classes are used
- **Refactor ‚Üí Rename:** Safe renaming with import updates

### Command Line
- **mkdir:** Create new package directories
- **mv:** Move files manually (requires manual import updates)
- **git mv:** Move with git tracking

### Gradle
- **./gradlew build:** Build and check for errors
- **./gradlew clean:** Clean build artifacts

## ü§ù Team Workflow

### For Team Lead
1. Review documentation
2. Plan reorganization timeline
3. Assign migration tasks
4. Review and merge changes

### For Developers
1. Understand new structure
2. Follow naming conventions
3. Use Quick Reference for new files
4. Keep code organized as you develop

### For New Members
1. Read CODE_ORGANIZATION.md
2. Study existing organized code
3. Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md
4. Ask questions when unsure

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Do we have to reorganize everything at once?
**A:** No! You can reorganize incrementally. Start with TeleOp files, then Drive, then Localization, etc.

### Q: Will this break our existing code?
**A:** No, if you update package declarations and imports correctly. The migration checklist includes test checkpoints.

### Q: What if we use a different structure?
**A:** These are recommendations, not requirements. Adapt to your team's needs, but stay consistent.

### Q: How do we handle merge conflicts during reorganization?
**A:** Do the reorganization in a separate branch, then merge when complete. Avoid developing new features during reorganization.

### Q: Should we reorganize Archive files too?
**A:** No, leave Archive files as-is. They're historical reference and don't need to be organized.
