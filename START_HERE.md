## ⚡ 30-Second Summary

### What's the Problem?
18 files are in the root `teamcode/` package when they should be in organized subdirectories.

### What Should We Do?
1. Create 3 new packages: `drive/`, `localization/`, `test/`
2. Move 24 files total to appropriate packages
3. Update package declarations and imports
4. Test and verify everything still works

### What's the Benefit?
- ✅ Find files 3x faster
- ✅ Better team collaboration
- ✅ Professional, maintainable code
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new members

## 📊 Current Status

```
✅ GOOD:
  - 10 organized packages (auton, config, subsystems, etc.)
  - 41 files properly organized
  - Archive folder for old code

⚠️  NEEDS WORK:
  - 18 files in root package
  - Missing packages: drive/, localization/, test/
  - Some test OpModes mixed with competition code
```

---

## 🎯 Target Structure

```
teamcode/
├── auton/          (competition autonomous)
├── teleop/         (competition teleop) ⬅ needs 5 more files
├── drive/          (drive systems) ⬅ NEW - needs 3 files
├── localization/   (position tracking) ⬅ NEW - needs 6 files
├── test/           (diagnostics) ⬅ NEW - needs 6 files
├── subsystems/     (robot mechanisms)
├── vision/         (computer vision) ⬅ needs 2 more files
├── config/         (configuration) ⬅ needs 1 more file
├── util/           (utilities) ⬅ needs 1 more file
├── tuning/         (tuning modes)
├── messages/       (data objects)

## 💡 Key Principles

1. **Organize by Purpose** - Group by what code does (teleop, auton, drive)
2. **Clear Naming** - Use descriptive names that explain purpose
3. **One Class Per File** - Each file has one public class
4. **Test After Each Move** - Verify code works after moving files
5. **Archive, Don't Delete** - Keep old code for reference

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know your organization is successful when:

- ✅ Any file can be found in < 1 minute
- ✅ New files have obvious correct location
- ✅ Root package contains only readme.md
- ✅ Team agrees on where things go
- ✅ New members can navigate code easily
